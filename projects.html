  <div id="elcamino" class="container">This black-on-black 1969 El Camino sports silver stripes and is now powered by a 454ci 8-cylinder engine with a Doug Nash 5-speed manual transmission and a 12-bolt posi-traction rear end.

  <div id="charger" class="container"> Finished in Spring Green, this Charger features the rare special promotional order Topper Package. In the spring of 1972, Dodge introduced a special promotional order package called the "Spring Green Topper X." Each of these cars had the same standard features, such as an exclusive bright green paint with a green gator half vinyl top and special white/green plaid interior. Every car came with hideaway headlights, front and rear bumper guards, an interior Rallye instrument cluster, interior hood release, sill, front and rear body moldings and an upper body paint pinstripe. Included with all the standard features of the Spring Green Topper X, this car was ordered with the rare factory-order code A07. The A07 package was the ultimate luxury package, which included air conditioning, power disc brakes, power steering and 12 other luxury options. Equipped with the original matching-numbers V8 engine and 3-speed automatic transmission, this example has just over 59,000 original miles. This is a dry car that has been garage-kept its entire life, with no major repairs ever needed. This Charger has the original Fender Tag, Build Sheet, factory original Window Sticker and copies of advertisements for this special-order package.</div>
